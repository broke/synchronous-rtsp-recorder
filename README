Introduction
============
This software is a proof of concept for synchronouse rtsp video source recording.
Two different video sources are recorded simultaneously into a matroska
container and synced to each other by the use of the NTP timestamp in the RTCP SR.
Watching the recorded video with VLC media player opens up two windows showing
both video streams in sync.
Currently everything is hardcoded in software and the software itself is not
well designed but this may change in the future.
